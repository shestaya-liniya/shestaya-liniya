# Yo!

I'm building **NotLost** — an app to make Telegram (and propably all of social life) a little less chaotic.

Making apps with a focus on intuitiveness and visualization.

> Telegram is messy. NotLost tries to fix that.

Background: 1 year as mobile dev at online school, solo dev of an app with 10M of users at peak
